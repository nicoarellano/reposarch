      “Architectural definition, in their surgical precision, reinforce and
      amplify the impossible alternatives: on the one hand, architecture as a
      thing of the mind, a dematerialized or conceptual discipline with its
      typological and morphological variations, and on the other, architecture
      as an empirical event that concentrates on the senses, on the experience
      of space” -- Bernard Tschumi
    </p>

    <p>
      One year of study in ED2 opened my eyes and lead me into the design world.
      How to perceive the environment? How to extract the information you need
      when you go on a site? How to build relationships between exterior
      conditions, such as wind and sunlight, and interior space? How to use
      sketches and designs to articulate your intention? How to and what can
      define a threshold? These well-designed projects in ED 2 resonate with
      Bernard’s quote, which is “experience”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, two years of intense study in the ED3 and ED4 in architecture
      stream force me to believe that architectural drawing sketches and
      modeling are not only the ways of thinking for architects but also a means
      to communicate with others. It is “a thing of the mind”. What is
      architecture? What consists of architecture? Considerations of
      materiality, space, void, mass, texture, movement, system, forms, orders,
      structure, artistic, abstract, and poetic aspects are all the clues that
      lead to the architectural world.
