 * Simple event handler by [Jason Kleban](https://gist.github.com/JasonKleban/50cee44960c225ac1993c922563aa540). Keep in mind that if you want to remove it later, you might want to declare the callback as an object. If you want to maintain the reference to `this`, you will need to declare the callback as an arrow function.
