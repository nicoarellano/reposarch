## BIM 🏗️

- A 3D object-based database
- Parametric
- Process change for the A/E/C/O/O industry (architecture/engineering/construction/owner/operator)
- Goal for lifecycle data/information pipeline
- The entire premise relies on sharing data in a real-time collaborative virtual environment (information exchange)
- Interoperability & Standards a greater challenge than with CAD
