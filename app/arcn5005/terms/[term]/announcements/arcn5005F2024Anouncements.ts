      "Thanks all for the great effort placed on Assignment 2. \
      I know it was a hard one. I understand that this is all very new for most of you so I understand if some of you get a bit frustrated. Is all part of the process and it is the only way of learning how to code, by facing hard problems in a short period of time. I hope you are learning and enjoying the results.     \
      If you still have big questions about the assignment, please send me an email and I can make myself available tomorrow morning (Friday, Nov 17th) for Zoom calls. I am extending the deadline until the end of Saturday for you to take your time and submit the best you can.&nbsp; \
      For those who have already submitted and are not completely happy about the submission, feel free to ask me more questions and submit again. \
      Remember that your submission must look different to my example. Now that you know how it works, please be creative and have fun with it (see for example Filipe's, Daphne's, Mikhala, Jenny, Cole, Evan, Jeremy, Keegan, Melanie, etc). There are great examples out there (that can also be improved if you want), take a look and learn from each other. Please revisit Assignment 1 and grab ideas from it, buttons, animations, background, etc. Make a good composition using both assignments. \
      I know that I didn't have time to talk about assignment 3, but don't worry, I will rearrange the dates so we are able to submit everything. We will talk about that next class. \
      Have a great weekend and see you next Thursday.",
