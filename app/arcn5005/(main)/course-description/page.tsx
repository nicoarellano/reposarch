        The course reflects on the use of computers and computer coding for
        architectural representation, and it analyses the different ways in
        which coding can impact architecture. <br />
        Since the 1970s, when computers became available to architects, this new
        human-computer relationship became a revolution for architecture in
        multiple fundamental aspects, such as representation, education, and
        practice. Half a century later, in the 2020s computers are not only
        available, but in most cases, they are indispensable. <br />
        Through this course students will learn how did we get here. We will
        recognize actors, processes and milestones that have led us into the
        scenario that we are in today where a handful of software vendors
        control the majority of the tools that architects use to design, build
        and manage buildings. Monopolistic practices such as vendor-lock-in have
        building professionals dependant on opaque proprietary software. <br />
        Software are sets of programs that have a specific function. Originally,
        back in the 50s, software were open systems written in human readable
        programming language that could be studied and modified by their users,
        however, software vendors created methods to prevent the free
        distribution of their products. The term open-software was pioneered
        first by the Free Software Foundation back in 1985 and popularized by
        the Open Source Initiative (1998) to regain the freedom for the user and
        software respectively. <br />
        Many industries, such a s GIS, IT, web and game developers, visual and
        media artist, media, entertainment, among others, have embraced free and
        open-source software in their workflows. With them, professionals can be
        as competitive as the ones utilizing proprietary software. However,
        architects are behind. The bast majority of the practice is done through
        proprietary software, which hinders collaboration, innovation, and
        interoperability. Because of these practices, the digital architectural
        practice has become a Black box. <br />
        The term <q>black box</q> to describe opaque computer processes has been
        used since early 1940s. It has its origins in electronic circuits to
        describe a system that can be understood only in terms of its inputs and
        outputs, but which process is not accessible or even visible to users.
        To <q>de-blackbox</q> is to understand the process, parts, and
        connection of the system. The historian Antoine Picon states that
        <q>
          it has become unavoidable to enter into the black box of programming
          in order to make a truly creative use of the computer.
        </q>
        <sup>1</sup> <br />
        However, two conditions must be met before architects can attempt to
        de-blackbox the digital toolbox. Firstly, architects must have a working
        knowledge of computer programming. Secondly, the source code—the list of
        human-readable instructions that define a computer program—of the
        software that they use must be accessible for modification by the user.
        <br />
        This course will explore both obstacles—digital oblivion and
        black-boxes—that architects must overcome in order to benefit from a
        fruitful relationship between programming and architecture. <br />
        Coding has the potential to further expand the current limits of our
        imagination. Computers are a tremendous contribution to our
        architectural exploration if we continue to explore innovative research
        that includes human input with computer logic and processing power to
        arrive at collaborative solutions. <br />
        Every class will be followed by a lab that will give students the skills
        to understand, modify, and to develop digital tools. This will give them
        awareness of the parts of a digital software in order to understand its
        biases and potential.
